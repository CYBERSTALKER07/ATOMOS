# Troubleshooting

## Authentication

- `Session expired.` → `higgsfield auth login`
- `Stored credentials are for ... but current environment ...` → `higgsfield auth login` for the current API URL.
- `Not authenticated.` → first `higgsfield auth login`.

## Validation

- `Missing required params: prompt` — user gave no prompt. Ask.
- `Missing required params: medias` on Virality Predictor (`brain_activity`) — pass exactly one video via `--video <path-or-id>`. Virality Predictor does not need `--prompt`.
- `Invalid values: <param>=<v> (allowed: ...)` — pick from allowed enum.
- `Unknown params: <name>` — schema doesn't accept this flag. Run `higgsfield model get <jst>` and check.

## Job lifecycle

- `Job ended with status "failed"` — server-side failure. Often prompt content / safety. Try rephrasing.
- `nsfw` / `ip_detected` — content policy. Rephrase.
- `Timeout after 10m` — model is slow today. Bump `--timeout 30m` or retry.

## Rate limits

`Higgsfield API error (HTTP 429)` — too many requests. Back off.

## CloudFlare / DataDome

If `Failed to decode response. Body: <html>...captcha-delivery...` appears, the server's anti-bot fired. Wait 30s and retry. If persistent, ping the team.

## Cost

`higgsfield generate cost <jst> ...` returns credit estimate without submitting. Useful when the user asks "how much will this cost?".

For workflows, use `higgsfield generate cost workflow <workflow_name> ...`, for example `higgsfield generate cost workflow reframe --duration 7.1 --resolution 1080p`. Do not use `higgsfield generate workflow cost ...`.


# Universal Agent & Engineering Guidelines
When developing, designing, or planning, always ensure to account for:
- Gaps, edge cases, and comprehensive feature validation.
- Best practices and optimized integration for Kafka, Redis, Backend, Optimizers, AI, and UI.
- Real-time concepts including WebSockets, webhooks, and their native app equivalents.
- Thorough business logic for features, understanding how the role, app, and ecosystem work together, and engagements with other roles and features.
- Best practices for backend, frontend, and infrastructure libraries/packages. Always prefer existing, high-quality open-source libraries and packages that best suit our features before creating our own.
- Optimal UI infrastructure and UX patterns (e.g., optimal screen positioning for drivers during an active route), applying the same high standards to backend and cloud architecture.
- ALWAYS search the web to find open-source code, libraries, packages, math, algorithms, approaches, and best practices for anything we are doing. If none exist, then create our own.
- Always search the web to get the correct logic, and incorporate edge cases, business logic for features, operations (ops), workflow, data consistency, finance, and AI into everything we do.
