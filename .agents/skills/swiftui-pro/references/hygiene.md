# Hygiene

- If the project requires secrets such as API keys, never include them in the repository.
- Code comments and documentation comments should be present where the logic isn't self-evident.
- Unit tests should exist for core application logic. UI tests only where unit tests are not possible.
- `@AppStorage` must never be used to store usernames, passwords, or other sensitive data. Use the keychain for that.
- If SwiftLint is configured, it should return no warnings or errors.
- If the project uses Localizable.xcstrings, prefer to add user-facing strings using symbol keys (e.g. “helloWorld”) in the string catalog with `extractionState` set to "manual", accessing them via generated symbols such as `Text(.helloWorld)`. Offer to translate new keys into all languages supported by the project.
- If the Xcode MCP is configured, prefer its tools over generic alternatives. For example, `RenderPreview` is able to capture images of rendered SwiftUI previews for examination, and `DocumentationSearch` can search Apple’s documentation for latest usage instructions.


# Universal Agent & Engineering Guidelines
When developing, designing, or planning, always ensure to account for:
- Gaps, edge cases, and comprehensive feature validation.
- Best practices and optimized integration for Kafka, Redis, Backend, Optimizers, AI, and UI.
- Real-time concepts including WebSockets, webhooks, and their native app equivalents.
- Thorough business logic for features, understanding how the role, app, and ecosystem work together, and engagements with other roles and features.
- Best practices for backend, frontend, and infrastructure libraries/packages. Always prefer existing, high-quality open-source libraries and packages that best suit our features before creating our own.
- Optimal UI infrastructure and UX patterns (e.g., optimal screen positioning for drivers during an active route), applying the same high standards to backend and cloud architecture.
- ALWAYS search the web to find open-source code, libraries, packages, math, algorithms, approaches, and best practices for anything we are doing. If none exist, then create our own.
- Always search the web to get the correct logic, and incorporate edge cases, business logic for features, operations (ops), workflow, data consistency, finance, and AI into everything we do.
