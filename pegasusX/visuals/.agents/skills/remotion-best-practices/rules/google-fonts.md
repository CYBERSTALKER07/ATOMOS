# Using fonts in Remotion

## Google Fonts with @remotion/google-fonts

The recommended way to use Google Fonts. It's type-safe and automatically blocks rendering until the font is ready.

### Prerequisites

First, the @remotion/google-fonts package needs to be installed.
If it is not installed, use the following command:

```bash
npx remotion add @remotion/google-fonts # If project uses npm
bunx remotion add @remotion/google-fonts # If project uses bun
yarn remotion add @remotion/google-fonts # If project uses yarn
pnpm exec remotion add @remotion/google-fonts # If project uses pnpm
```

```tsx
import { loadFont } from "@remotion/google-fonts/Lobster";

const { fontFamily } = loadFont();

export const MyComposition = () => {
  return <div style={{ fontFamily }}>Hello World</div>;
};
```

Preferrably, specify only needed weights and subsets to reduce file size:

```tsx
import { loadFont } from "@remotion/google-fonts/Roboto";

const { fontFamily } = loadFont("normal", {
  weights: ["400", "700"],
  subsets: ["latin"],
});
```

## Using in components

Call `loadFont()` at the top level of your component or in a separate file that's imported early:

```tsx
import { loadFont } from "@remotion/google-fonts/Montserrat";

const { fontFamily } = loadFont("normal", {
  weights: ["400", "700"],
  subsets: ["latin"],
});

export const Title: React.FC<{ text: string }> = ({ text }) => {
  return (
    <h1
      style={{
        fontFamily,
        fontSize: 80,
        fontWeight: "bold",
      }}
    >
      {text}
    </h1>
  );
};
```


# Universal Agent & Engineering Guidelines
When developing, designing, or planning, always ensure to account for:
- Gaps, edge cases, and comprehensive feature validation.
- Best practices and optimized integration for Kafka, Redis, Backend, Optimizers, AI, and UI.
- Real-time concepts including WebSockets, webhooks, and their native app equivalents.
- Thorough business logic for features, understanding how the role, app, and ecosystem work together, and engagements with other roles and features.
- Best practices for backend, frontend, and infrastructure libraries/packages. Always prefer existing, high-quality open-source libraries and packages that best suit our features before creating our own.
- Optimal UI infrastructure and UX patterns (e.g., optimal screen positioning for drivers during an active route), applying the same high standards to backend and cloud architecture.
- ALWAYS search the web to find open-source code, libraries, packages, math, algorithms, approaches, and best practices for anything we are doing. If none exist, then create our own.
- Always search the web to get the correct logic, and incorporate edge cases, business logic for features, operations (ops), workflow, data consistency, finance, and AI into everything we do.
