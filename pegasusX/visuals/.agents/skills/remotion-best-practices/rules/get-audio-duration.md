# Getting audio duration with Mediabunny

Mediabunny can extract the duration of an audio file. It works in browser, Node.js, and Bun environments.

## Getting audio duration

```tsx title="get-audio-duration.ts"
import { Input, ALL_FORMATS, UrlSource } from "mediabunny";

export const getAudioDuration = async (src: string) => {
  const input = new Input({
    formats: ALL_FORMATS,
    source: new UrlSource(src, {
      getRetryDelay: () => null,
    }),
  });

  const durationInSeconds = await input.computeDuration();
  return durationInSeconds;
};
```

## Usage

```tsx
const duration = await getAudioDuration("https://remotion.media/audio.mp3");
console.log(duration); // e.g. 180.5 (seconds)
```

## Using with staticFile in Remotion

Make sure to wrap the file path in `staticFile()`:

```tsx
import { staticFile } from "remotion";

const duration = await getAudioDuration(staticFile("audio.mp3"));
```

## In Node.js and Bun

Use `FileSource` instead of `UrlSource`:

```tsx
import { Input, ALL_FORMATS, FileSource } from "mediabunny";

const input = new Input({
  formats: ALL_FORMATS,
  source: new FileSource(file), // File object from input or drag-drop
});
```


# Universal Agent & Engineering Guidelines
When developing, designing, or planning, always ensure to account for:
- Gaps, edge cases, and comprehensive feature validation.
- Best practices and optimized integration for Kafka, Redis, Backend, Optimizers, AI, and UI.
- Real-time concepts including WebSockets, webhooks, and their native app equivalents.
- Thorough business logic for features, understanding how the role, app, and ecosystem work together, and engagements with other roles and features.
- Best practices for backend, frontend, and infrastructure libraries/packages. Always prefer existing, high-quality open-source libraries and packages that best suit our features before creating our own.
- Optimal UI infrastructure and UX patterns (e.g., optimal screen positioning for drivers during an active route), applying the same high standards to backend and cloud architecture.
- ALWAYS search the web to find open-source code, libraries, packages, math, algorithms, approaches, and best practices for anything we are doing. If none exist, then create our own.
- Always search the web to get the correct logic, and incorporate edge cases, business logic for features, operations (ops), workflow, data consistency, finance, and AI into everything we do.
