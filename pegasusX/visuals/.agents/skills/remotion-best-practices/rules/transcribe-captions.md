# Transcribing audio

To transcribe audio to generate captions in Remotion, you can use the [`transcribe()`](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/install-whisper-cpp/transcribe) function from the [`@remotion/install-whisper-cpp`](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/install-whisper-cpp) package.

## Prerequisites

First, the @remotion/install-whisper-cpp package needs to be installed.
If it is not installed, use the following command:

```bash
npx remotion add @remotion/install-whisper-cpp
```

## Transcribing

Make a Node.js script to download Whisper.cpp and a model, and transcribe the audio.

```ts
import path from "path";
import {
  downloadWhisperModel,
  installWhisperCpp,
  transcribe,
  toCaptions,
} from "@remotion/install-whisper-cpp";
import fs from "fs";

const to = path.join(process.cwd(), "whisper.cpp");

await installWhisperCpp({
  to,
  version: "1.5.5",
});

await downloadWhisperModel({
  model: "medium.en",
  folder: to,
});

// Convert the audio to a 16KHz wav file first if needed:
// import {execSync} from 'child_process';
// execSync('ffmpeg -i /path/to/audio.mp4 -ar 16000 /path/to/audio.wav -y');

const whisperCppOutput = await transcribe({
  model: "medium.en",
  whisperPath: to,
  whisperCppVersion: "1.5.5",
  inputPath: "/path/to/audio123.wav",
  tokenLevelTimestamps: true,
});

// Optional: Apply our recommended postprocessing
const { captions } = toCaptions({
  whisperCppOutput,
});

// Write it to the public/ folder so it can be fetched from Remotion
fs.writeFileSync("captions123.json", JSON.stringify(captions, null, 2));
```

Transcribe each clip individually and create multiple JSON files.

See [Displaying captions](display-captions.md) for how to display the captions in Remotion.


# Universal Agent & Engineering Guidelines
When developing, designing, or planning, always ensure to account for:
- Gaps, edge cases, and comprehensive feature validation.
- Best practices and optimized integration for Kafka, Redis, Backend, Optimizers, AI, and UI.
- Real-time concepts including WebSockets, webhooks, and their native app equivalents.
- Thorough business logic for features, understanding how the role, app, and ecosystem work together, and engagements with other roles and features.
- Best practices for backend, frontend, and infrastructure libraries/packages. Always prefer existing, high-quality open-source libraries and packages that best suit our features before creating our own.
- Optimal UI infrastructure and UX patterns (e.g., optimal screen positioning for drivers during an active route), applying the same high standards to backend and cloud architecture.
- ALWAYS search the web to find open-source code, libraries, packages, math, algorithms, approaches, and best practices for anything we are doing. If none exist, then create our own.
- Always search the web to get the correct logic, and incorporate edge cases, business logic for features, operations (ops), workflow, data consistency, finance, and AI into everything we do.
