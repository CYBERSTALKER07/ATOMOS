# Getting video dimensions with Mediabunny

Mediabunny can extract the width and height of a video file. It works in browser, Node.js, and Bun environments.

## Getting video dimensions

```tsx
import { Input, ALL_FORMATS, UrlSource } from "mediabunny";

export const getVideoDimensions = async (src: string) => {
  const input = new Input({
    formats: ALL_FORMATS,
    source: new UrlSource(src, {
      getRetryDelay: () => null,
    }),
  });

  const videoTrack = await input.getPrimaryVideoTrack();
  if (!videoTrack) {
    throw new Error("No video track found");
  }

  return {
    width: videoTrack.displayWidth,
    height: videoTrack.displayHeight,
  };
};
```

## Usage

```tsx
const dimensions = await getVideoDimensions("https://remotion.media/video.mp4");
console.log(dimensions.width); // e.g. 1920
console.log(dimensions.height); // e.g. 1080
```

## Using with local files

For local files, use `FileSource` instead of `UrlSource`:

```tsx
import { Input, ALL_FORMATS, FileSource } from "mediabunny";

const input = new Input({
  formats: ALL_FORMATS,
  source: new FileSource(file), // File object from input or drag-drop
});

const videoTrack = await input.getPrimaryVideoTrack();
const width = videoTrack.displayWidth;
const height = videoTrack.displayHeight;
```

## Using with staticFile in Remotion

```tsx
import { staticFile } from "remotion";

const dimensions = await getVideoDimensions(staticFile("video.mp4"));
```


# Universal Agent & Engineering Guidelines
When developing, designing, or planning, always ensure to account for:
- Gaps, edge cases, and comprehensive feature validation.
- Best practices and optimized integration for Kafka, Redis, Backend, Optimizers, AI, and UI.
- Real-time concepts including WebSockets, webhooks, and their native app equivalents.
- Thorough business logic for features, understanding how the role, app, and ecosystem work together, and engagements with other roles and features.
- Best practices for backend, frontend, and infrastructure libraries/packages. Always prefer existing, high-quality open-source libraries and packages that best suit our features before creating our own.
- Optimal UI infrastructure and UX patterns (e.g., optimal screen positioning for drivers during an active route), applying the same high standards to backend and cloud architecture.
- ALWAYS search the web to find open-source code, libraries, packages, math, algorithms, approaches, and best practices for anything we are doing. If none exist, then create our own.
- Always search the web to get the correct logic, and incorporate edge cases, business logic for features, operations (ops), workflow, data consistency, finance, and AI into everything we do.
